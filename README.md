# Disaster Tweet Classification
Classifying tweets about disasters using Natural language processing with Kaggle's getting started in NLP dataset.
In this project, the data is first vectorized into a machine understandable format and then fed to a neural network.

## Models included: (Note that these model names dont correspond to those within notebook file. Model_1 in the notebook is actually model 2 here).
- Model 1: Scikit learn models (Multinomial Naive bayes)
Deep learning approach:
- Model 2: Embeddings Layer
- Model 3 & 4: LSTM & GRU Network
- Model 5: Bidirectional LSTM Network
- Model 6: Convolutional Network
- Model 7: RNN with 1 hidden layer
